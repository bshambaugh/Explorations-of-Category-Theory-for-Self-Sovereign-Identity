Look at the Defintion of a Group:
   - Chapter 5 - Key Exchanges, Real World Cryptography, David Wong
   - Group Theory and Its Applications to Physical Problems - Morton Hammermesh

Look at the Definition of a Category:
    - Topoi - The Categorical Analysis of Logic

Look at Groups as Categories:
  Consider: (this turns out to be Dr. Steve Adowey's book suggested by Dr. Ryan Wisenesky)
    - https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/80-413-713/
      - https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/80-413-713/notes/chap04.pdf (begin discussion about Group Theory in Category Theory Book ... consider this for ECC and ECDSA involving groups and apply to C.T.)
     
      Steve Adowey's work seems very relevent. Also check out:

Look at Groups Applied to Cryptography:
  - Chapter 5 - Key Exchanges, Real World Cryptography, David Wong
  
Look at the construction of a DID document and a verifiable credential document.
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/
  Consider:
      - https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt-vc
  Conversion of JSON-LD VC to JWT Payload, pg 138-139, Ch 7 Verifiable Credentials, Self-Sovereign Identity, Pruekschat et al., Manning
  JSON Web Token Format, pg 102, 5.4.1, ibid.

Look at Category Theory Applied to RDF:

     - I'm probably just worrying again (https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Sep/0075.html)
        - Re (Wayne Chang)--> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281367586_A_Category_Theoretic_Model_of_RDF_Ontology

In light of this madness with Category Theory, also look at https://fission.codes/blog/project-cambria-overview/ since Boris Mann and Brooklyn Zelenka (who may share some sentiments but tbd) probably have a point about not overcomplicating things for developers.

In context also consider Layered Schema Architecture: https://github.com/cloudprivacylabs/lsa and Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) schema specifications: https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz .
